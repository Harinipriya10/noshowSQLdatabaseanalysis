************************************************************BRAZILIAN NMEDICAL NO-SHOW DATA ANALYSIS******************************************************



Project is about using SQL queries to extract, analyze, and interpret insights from a structured healthcare dataset (Medical Appointment No Shows).
Dataset Used:
Medical Appointment No Shows dataset from Kaggle (Uploaded as appointments table in MySQL)

Tools used:
MySQL Community Server
MySQL Workbench (SQL GUI)
CSV file (cleaned_noshowappointments.csv)

Deliverables:
".sql" file with all queries (noshowmedicaldb.sql)

Insights Gained:
* Higher no-show rate in certain neighborhoods
* Older patients (> average age) show a tendency to attend more
* Gender has minimal impact on no-show behavior (can confirm through additional queries)
* Views and indexes simplify repeated analysis and improve query speed

Obtained outcome:
* Successfully used SQL to:
* Explore and manipulate real-world structured data
* Extract actionable insights from healthcare data
* Gain hands-on experience with key SQL concepts: filtering, grouping, joins, views, indexing
